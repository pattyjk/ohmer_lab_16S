Usage: qiime deblur denoise-16S [OPTIONS]

  Perform sequence quality control for Illumina data using the Deblur workflow
  with a 16S reference as a positive filter. Only forward reads are supported
  at this time. The specific reference used is the 88% OTUs from Greengenes
  13_8. This mode of operation should only be used when data were generated
  from a 16S amplicon protocol on an Illumina platform. The reference is only
  used to assess whether each sequence is likely to be 16S by a local
  alignment using SortMeRNA with a permissive e-value; the reference is not
  used to characterize the sequences.

Inputs:
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs ARTIFACT SampleData[SequencesWithQuality |
    PairedEndSequencesWithQuality | JoinedSequencesWithQuality]
                         The demultiplexed sequences to be denoised.

  --p-min-size INTEGER   In each sample, discard all features with an
                         abundance less than min-size.            [default: 2]
  --p-jobs-to-start INTEGER
                         Number of jobs to start (if to run in parallel).
                                                                  [default: 1]

Usage: qiime taxa barplot [OPTIONS]

  This visualizer produces an interactive barplot visualization of taxonomies.
  Interactive features include multi-level sorting, plot recoloring, sample
  relabeling, and SVG figure export.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency | PresenceAbsence]
                         Feature table to visualize at various taxonomic
                         levels.                                    [required]
  --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                         Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided
                         feature table. All features in the feature table must
                         have a corresponding taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic
                         annotations that are not present in the feature table
                         will be ignored. If no taxonomy is provided, the
                         feature IDs will be used as labels.        [optional]
Parameters:
  --m-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple            The sample metadata.
     arguments will be   
     merged)                                                        [optional]
  --p-level-delimiter TEXT
                         Attempt to parse hierarchical taxonomic information
                         from feature IDs by separating levels with this
                         character. This parameter is ignored if a taxonomy is
                         provided as input.                         [optional]
